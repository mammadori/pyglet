Making a pyglet release
-----------------------

**Not complete**

0. svn up && tools/gendoc.sh
0.5 rm -rf dist/*
1. Update version string in setup.py and pyglet/__init__.py
2. Source, egg and doc releases:

        tools/gendist.sh

   Creates .eggs, .tar.gzs and .zips in dist/

3. Mac OS X release (requires OS X 10.4 and developer tools installed)::

        tools/genmpkg/genmpkg.sh

   Creates .dmg in dist/

4. Windows release (requires WIX 3.0 UNSTABLE -- currently at 3.0.3022.0.  WIX
   bin/ must be in PATH)::

        python tools/genmsi/genmsi.py
  
   Creates .msi in dist/


Still untested, must be done before alpha:
  * Source distros on any platform
  * Eggs on any platform: both to be installed and without installation
    ('require')
  * Windows Vista
  * Upgrade of Mac OS X install (after changing version string to beta, etc)
  * Mac OS X with Python 2.4 + ctypes (ctypes didn't compile on my mac).
  * Mac OS X 10.3

Still to be decided:
  * Note that not all files currently have $Id: $ filled in.. presumably a
    their SVN keyword bits are not set properly (i hate that crap, why can't
    it just do it on all text files?).
  * Should tests/ be added into the distros?  We want alpha testers to both
    run the tests and use the distros (rather than svn), so this seems like a
    good idea.  tests/ should definitely be left out of the final release
    though.
  * Should examples/ and doc/ be added to the Windows and OS X installers?  I
    have not done so at the moment because I consider these to be "end-user"
    runtime installs.. people who don't really know what python is but have
    been told to install things.  The examples/ and doc/ are in a separate zip
    download, which obviously doesn't need an installer.  I'm pretty happy
    with this setup, but maybe people like all-in-ones, or maybe they want
    documentation linked from the start menu, or something..?
