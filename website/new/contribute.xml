    pyglet is currently in alpha release, and many features are not yet fully
    documented.  If you're using pyglet today, sign up to the mailing list
    for developer support.  Let us know when you find bugs, or if you have
    a feature request.
  </p>

  <h2>mailing lists</h2>
  <p>
    The main forum for pyglet discussion is the <a
    href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-users">pyglet-users</a>
    mailing list.  You can browse the mailing list online or provide your
    email address for immediate or digest updates.

  <p>
    There are two more mailing lists if you're interested in following the
    progress of pyglet development:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a
    href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-issues">pyglet-issues</a> is
    an announcement list which broadcasts emails from the issue tracker.</li>

    <li><a
    href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-commits">pyglet-commits</a> is
    an announcement list which broadcasts SVN commits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>user pages</h2>

  <p>Members of the pyglet-users mailing list can collaborate to <a
  href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-users/files">upload files</a>
  and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-users/web">create web
  pages</a>.  Screenshots from these pages will soon appear on pyglet.org to
  promote your projects as well as pyglet.</p>

  <p>Members can also contribute to the <a
  href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-users/web/faq">FAQ</a>, or write
  new tutorials and "howto"s.</p>

  <h2>issue tracker</h2>

  <p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyglet/issues/list">issue tracker</a>
  should be used to report any bugs or compatibility issues.  You will need
  a <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/signup">Google account</a> to submit
  issues.</p>

  <h2>wiki</h2>

  <p>We have a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyglet/w/list">wiki</a> which
  is primarily used for discussing future design aspects of pyglet.  Anyone
  can read this wiki, however you must be a pyglet developer (have SVN commit
  access) to write to it.</p>

  <h2>subversion repository</h2>

  <p>The subversion repository houses the source trunk, documentation,
  examples and development tools.  You can <a
  href="http://pyglet.googlecode.com/svn/">browse the repository</a> or check
  out a working copy using an SVN client:</p>

  <p class="console">svn checkout http://pyglet.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  pyglet</p>

  <h2>contact</h2>
