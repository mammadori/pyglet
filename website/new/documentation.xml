  <p>The pyglet programming guide is currently under development, and will
  be available when Beta 1 is released.</p>

  <p>The API reference is included in the source and documentation
  distributions, but not yet available for viewing online.</p>

  <p>There are several documented example applications located in the
  <tt>examples</tt> directory of the source and documentation distributions.</p>

  <p>A short, but hopefully growing, <a
  href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-users/web/faq">FAQ</a> is online
  and awaiting your contributions.</p>
