    The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-users/web/faq">FAQ</a>
    has been moved to a more permanent home where all pyglet-users members can
    contribute.  The <a
    href="http://code.google.com/p/pyglet/w/list">development wiki</a> has
    been moved to Google to make room for some forthcoming documentation.
    <p>We'd also like to point you in the direction of the <a
    href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyglet-users/web">user web
    pages</a> that can be created within the pyglet-users group.  Screenshots
    from these pages will soon be appearing on pyglet.org.</p>

        title="Approaching Beta">
    Some major package reorganisation during the past few weeks has cleaned up
    the code base and put us on track for a Beta release in the next couple of
    months.  Work has begun on the audio and video modules, which will provide
    surround sound and support for as many codecs as you have installed.
