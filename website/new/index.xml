  <h2>about pyglet</h2>
  <p>
    pyglet provides an object-oriented programming interface for developing
    games and other visually-rich applications for Windows, Mac OS X and
    Linux.  Some of the features of pyglet are:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>No external dependencies or installation
      requirements.</strong>  Users of
      your application need only install Python to experience a first-class
      application featuring 3D graphics, sound and video.  pyglet is written
      in pure Python, so no dangerous binaries are required.</li>

      <li><strong>Take advantage of multiple windows and multi-monitor
      desktops.</strong>  pyglet allows you to use as many windows as you
      need, and is fully aware of multi-monitor setups for use with
      fullscreen games.</li>

      <li><strong>Load images, sound, music and video in almost any
      format.</strong> pyglet can use any installed codecs to read media
      files.  On Windows, Linux and Mac OS X this means you get access to
      PNG, JPEG, MP3, MPEG-1 and many other file types even with a clean
      operating system install.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>pyglet is provided under the BSD open-source license, allowing you to
  use it for both commerical and other open-source projects with very
  little restriction.</p>
