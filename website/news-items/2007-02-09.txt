When you use OpenGL through pyglet now, you'll get access to all of the latest
extensions.  This includes, for example, the nVidia 8800 geometry shader.  A
new tool that generates this layer will ensure that it is kept up-to-date as the
latest versions of OpenGL and more ARB and proprietary extensions are released.
