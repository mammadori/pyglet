Some major package reorganisation during the past few weeks has cleaned up the
code base and put us on track for a Beta release in the next couple of months.
Work has begun on the audio and video modules, which will provide surround
sound and support for as many codecs as you have installed.  

Both myself and Richard will be participating in <a

my "Ambling" entry as I'll be using pyglet.
