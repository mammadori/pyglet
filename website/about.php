$title = "About pyglet";

<p>pyglet is a cross-platform gaming / multimedia library written in
pure Python.  It uses built-in operating system facilities on Linux, Mac OS X
and Windows to provide windowing, drawing, event handling and so on.
</p>

<p>pyglet is still under development, and does not yet have any releases.  We
are working towards a Beta release in this half of the year.  In the meantime,
you can checkout a copy of the source tree; see the instructions in "Getting
Involved".</p>

<p><strong>Pyglet is designed with the following goals:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Requirements for running are Python and ctypes.</li>
<li>No compilation.</li>
<li>Feature-full and easy to use API.</li>
<li>Fast enough for writing games.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The current status of pyglet is broadly:</strong></p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Y=Yes, N=No, A=Active Development, P=Partial, "alpha" means it'll
probably change, "beta" means it probably won't change, "solid" means
it's really not likely to change at all. Probably.</li>
<li>A "Y" indicates that the implementation meets the current spec defined
in the requirements doc. We have some additional features we'd like to
implement (for example, changing screen modes, scroll event needs x,y of
mouse).</li>
