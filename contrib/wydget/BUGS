KNOWN BUGS
----------

- NO DOCUMENTATION
- VERY LITTLE CODE DOCUMENTATION
- no dialog tests
- assets are poorly-located for packaging
- elements with negative padding are not rendered "correctly"
  . reject negative padding?
- Layouts:
  . columns & horizontal fill layouts have bogus RHS padding
- Tables:
  . table columns don't truncate
  . also, tables are stupidly slow
- Text Line:
  . selection out of the text line's bounds doesn't scroll the text
  . cursor movement during selection doesn't create new selection if
    cursor is out of old selection
- Drop-down menus:
  . are really single-element selections
  . are poorly-structured and don't cope with resizing
- Button:
  . <ah> buttons remain charged when mouse leaves the button with mouse down.
- TextButton:
  . <ah> with over and press colour, appears to flicker to the default
    colour for one frame when mouse is pressed or released (e.g. last 
    button in test_button)
- DropDownMenu
  . <ah> Doesn't open menu on mouse press.
- Element
  . <ah> Right border is inset by one pixel (evident in test_element,
    test_drawer and test_dropdown)
  . <ah> Negative padding obscures text at top (test_element, 4th element),
    missing top-left and bottom-right corners.
- test_element_over
  . <ah> Move mouse from outside window into inner generates ENTER inner,
    ENTER outer (bad nesting when mouse then leaves ENTER inner).
- Scroll bar
  . <ah> No repeat behaviour when clicking in bar
- RepeatButton
  . <ah> Continues repeating while mouse has left the button (evident in
    test_frame)
- test_menu
  . <ah> No Ctrl-click on Mac?
- test_movie
  . <ah> Not yet changed to pyglet-1.0alpha2
  . <ah> File dialog: type "/Volumes/someth" (contents of /Volumes is still
    shown), then click on an item; incorrectly appends to "someth" instead
    of replacing it.
- test_table
  . <ah> Width of horizontal scrollbar thumb is incorrect.
- TextInput
  . <ah> Caret continues flashing while typing or moving.
  . <ah> Caret not visible at right edge of entry (probably just element border
    problem).
  . <ah> Selecting text with mouse moves the caret to the wrong place.
  . <ah> Moving caret should deselect any selected text.
  . <ah> Double-clicking selects entire field, not single word.
  . <ah> Word motion events not yet implemented.
  . <ah> Caret motion past edge of field should scroll enough to get caret
    into the center of the field (or to limit).
  . <ah> Clicking on non-focusable background should not remove focus from
    text field.
- PasswordInput
  . <ah> Dot glyphs are clipped by 3 or 4 pixels on right edge.


DEFINITE AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT
-----------------------------

Allow style as an argument to Element construction.

Text size handling is currently a hack because many fonts have ridiculous
descender values. We're also forcing pyglet to not use glyph substitution
because that results in a huge descender *regardless* of the font
specified.

To get around this, I am going to look into changing how text positioning
and sizing is specified in wydget:

1. all text will be positioned by baseline offset from bottom of element
2. size of resultant rendered text will be overridable


KNOWN AREAS OF (POSSIBLE) REWRITING
-----------------------------------

Frames could be the only things that have children:

- move all child handling stuff from Element to Frame
- get rid of Frame.is_transparent
- lots of other cleanups as a result

Border model should be fixed so border doesn't have automagic padding?

Use layout's element model at the core.

The style module and the way XML files are styled will be overhauled at
some point. The current styling of elements is unlikely to change
significantly though. Never say never, of course.

The table implementation is terrible.
