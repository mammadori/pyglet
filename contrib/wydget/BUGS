KNOWN BUGS
----------

- NO DOCUMENTATION
- VERY LITTLE CODE DOCUMENTATION
- slider sizing isn't correct
- slider movement isn't correct when clicking beside the bar
- table columns don't truncate
- also, tables are stupidly slow
- assets are poorly-located for packaging
- dragged elements should be rendered on top of everything else 
- XHTML labels will just be truncated when they don't fit a texture
- oh yeah, selection lists are slow too
- border model should be fixed so border doesn't automagic padding
- text weights for button-on-image are clearly different to -on-rect()
- file dialog doesn't understand ~
- file dialog needs to understand dir "foo" == "foo/"
- <ah> right-hand border of text in test_button not rendered
- top-left pixel of any border not rendered
- buttons in test_drawer have an extra line of white to the right of the
  border
- <ah> overdraw inconsistency between drawers and their buttons
- <ah> can see individual elements of drawer move during animation (probably
  subpixel positioned)
- text in test_menu is blurry
- <ah> test_movie crashes when movie finishes
- <ah> cannot open another movie once first movie has started
- text input scrolling always wants to be as left as possible, rather than
  keeping the current viewport
- text input cursor is lost at far right 


KNOWN AREAS OF REWRITING
------------------------

Nothing's resizeable, and it all needs to be.

The style module and the way XML files are styled will be overhauled at
some point. The current styling of elements is unlikely to change
significantly though. Never say never, of course.

The table implementation is terrible.

Z positioning is largely ignored or otherwise abused.
