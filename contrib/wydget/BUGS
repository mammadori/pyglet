KNOWN BUGS
----------

- NO DOCUMENTATION
- VERY LITTLE CODE DOCUMENTATION
- assets are poorly-located for packaging
- view clipping problem: see test_selection first test
- Tables:
  . table columns don't truncate
  . also, tables are stupidly slow
- Dragging:
  . dragged elements should be rendered on top of everything else 
  . sometimes slider bar drags don't register
- Selection Lists:
  . oh yeah, selection lists are slow too
- Text Line:
  . selection out of the text line's bounds doesn't scroll the text
  . cursor movement during selection doesn't create new selection if
    cursor is out of old selection


KNOWN AREAS OF (POSSIBLE) REWRITING
-----------------------------------

Border model should be fixed so border doesn't have automagic padding

Use layout's element model at the core.

Nothing's resizeable, and it all needs to be.

The style module and the way XML files are styled will be overhauled at
some point. The current styling of elements is unlikely to change
significantly though. Never say never, of course.

The table implementation is terrible.

Z positioning is largely ignored or otherwise abused.
