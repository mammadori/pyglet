KNOWN BUGS
----------

- NO DOCUMENTATION
- VERY LITTLE CODE DOCUMENTATION
- slider sizing isn't correct
- slider movement isn't correct when clicking beside the bar
- table columns don't truncate
- also, tables are stupidly slow
- assets are poorly-located for packaging
- dragged elements should be rendered on top of everything else 


KNOWN AREAS OF REWRITING
------------------------

The style module and the way XML files are styled will be overhauled at
some point. The current styling of elements is unlikely to change
significantly though. Never say never, of course.

The table implementation is terrible.

Z positioning is largely ignored or otherwise abused.
