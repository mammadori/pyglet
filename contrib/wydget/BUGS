KNOWN BUGS
----------

- NO DOCUMENTATION
- VERY LITTLE CODE DOCUMENTATION
- assets are poorly-located for packaging
- border model should be fixed so border doesn't have automagic padding
- view clipping problem: see test_selection first test
- borders aren't clipped to view properly (all four sides are still drawn)
- top-left pixel of any border not rendered
- Sliders:
  . sliders in inner frame in test_frame.xml are misbehaving
- Tables:
  . table columns don't truncate
  . also, tables are stupidly slow
- Dragging:
  . dragged elements should be rendered on top of everything else 
- Selection Lists:
  . oh yeah, selection lists are slow too
- Buttons:
  . <ah> right-hand border of text in test_button not rendered
- File Dialog:
  . file dialog doesn't understand ~
  . file dialog needs to understand dir "foo" == "foo/"
- Movies:
  . <ah> test_movie crashes when movie finishes
  . <ah> cannot open another movie once first movie has started
    (rj can't reproduce this)


KNOWN AREAS OF REWRITING
------------------------

Nothing's resizeable, and it all needs to be.

The style module and the way XML files are styled will be overhauled at
some point. The current styling of elements is unlikely to change
significantly though. Never say never, of course.

The table implementation is terrible.

Z positioning is largely ignored or otherwise abused.
