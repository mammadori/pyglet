KNOWN BUGS
----------

- NO DOCUMENTATION
- VERY LITTLE CODE DOCUMENTATION
- no dialog tests
- assets are poorly-located for packaging
- elements with negative padding are not rendered "correctly"
  . reject negative padding?
- Layouts:
  . columns & horizontal fill layouts have bogus RHS padding
- Tables:
  . table columns don't truncate
  . also, tables are stupidly slow
- Text Line:
  . selection out of the text line's bounds doesn't scroll the text
  . cursor movement during selection doesn't create new selection if
    cursor is out of old selection
- Drop-down menus:
  . are really single-element selections
  . are poorly-structured and don't cope with resizing

DEFINITE AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT
-----------------------------

Allow style as an argument to Element construction.

Text size handling is currently a hack because many fonts have ridiculous
descender values. We're also forcing pyglet to not use glyph substitution
because that results in a huge descender *regardless* of the font
specified.

To get around this, I am going to look into changing how text positioning
and sizing is specified in wydget:

1. all text will be positioned by baseline offset from bottom of element
2. size of resultant rendered text will be overridable


KNOWN AREAS OF (POSSIBLE) REWRITING
-----------------------------------

Frames could be the only things that have children:

- move all child handling stuff from Element to Frame
- get rid of Frame.is_transparent
- lots of other cleanups as a result

Border model should be fixed so border doesn't have automagic padding?

Use layout's element model at the core.

The style module and the way XML files are styled will be overhauled at
some point. The current styling of elements is unlikely to change
significantly though. Never say never, of course.

The table implementation is terrible.
